Test task for a job application:
The task is to create a login system. The interface design is available in Figma. If possible, implement it in React.js/Next.js.
Create a NestJS backend that uses a PostgreSQL or MariaDB database to actually verify whether the user exists in the database and whether the correct password was entered.
Based on this, it should return a response, and the frontend should display whether the login attempt was successful or not. No additional subpages are required.
If possible, implement the solution in Docker.
